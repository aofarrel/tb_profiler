# Drug Resistance in TB
*note: This is an informal reference document. Proper literature is cited at the end.*

TB is notorious for developing drug resistance, so much so that we've not only had to catagorize it into catagories of drug resistance, but we've even had to update those catagories over time. In 2021, the WHO updated their definitions of TB drug resistance with regard to XDR.<sup>[1]</sup>

### MDR-TB (**M**ulti**d**rug **R**esistance)
> Resistance to at least both isoniazid and rifampicin.<sup>[2]</sup>

### Monoresistant
> Resistance to one first-line anti-TB drug only.<sup>[2]</sup> 

### Polydrug Resistance
> Resistance to more than one first-line anti-TB drug, other than both isoniazid and rifampicin.<sup>[2]</sup> 

### Pre-XDR-TB
> TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) strains that fulfil the definition of MDR/RR-TB and that are also resistant to any fluoroquinolone<sup>[1]</sup> 

### RR-TB (**R**ifampicin **R**esistance)
> Resistance to rifampicin detected using phenotypic or genotypic methods, with or without resistance to other anti-TB drugs. It includes any resistance to rifampicin, whether monoresistance, multidrug resistance, polydrug resistance, or extensive drug resistance.<sup>[2]</sup>

### Sensitive
TB that appears to lack drug resistance. The current (as of 2013) treatment for this is taking isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for six months.<sup>[3]</sup> 

### XDR-TB (e**X**tensively **D**rug **R**esistance)
> TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) strains that fulfil the definition of MDR/RR-TB and that are also resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one additional group A drug<sup>[1]</sup> 

Effectively this means that XDR-TB is MDR/RR-TB that is resistant to a fluoroquinolone and either bedaquiline or linezolid (or both). This might change if more drugs are added to group A later.<sup>[1]</sup> 

Prior to 2021, the definition was instead:
> TB that is resistant to any fluoroquinolone and to at least one of three second-line injectable drugs (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin), in addition to multidrug resistance<sup>[1]</sup> 


## Antibiotics (non-exhaustive list!)

### bedaquiline
Approved by the FDA to treat MDR-TB in 2013. Recently been made available as a generic.

### ethambutol
First-line treatement.<sup>[3]</sup> 

### fluoroquinolone
Includes levofloxacin and moxifloxacin.<sup>[1]</sup> 

### group A
A group of antibiotics that currently includes levofloxacin/moxifloxacin, bedaquiline, and linezolid.<sup>[1]</sup> 

### isoniazid
First-line treatment.<sup>[3]</sup> 

### linezolid
Antibiotic generally used as an alternative to vancomycin for the likes of MRSA and strep,<sup>[4]</sup> but can also be used against TB.

### pyrazinamide
First-line treatment.<sup>[3]</sup> 

### rifampicin
Most effective first-line treatment for TB.<sup>[3]</sup>
